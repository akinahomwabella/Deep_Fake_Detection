Deepfake Detection for Online Misinformation
This repository contains a real-time deepfake detection system designed to combat the spread of online misinformation by identifying manipulated video content. The system uses transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 and XceptionNet models to detect deepfake videos and analyze frames in real-time. It was developed using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Google Colab, leveraging the DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge) dataset for training.

Overview
Deepfakes have become a significant issue for online misinformation, posing risks to individuals and organizations alike. This project addresses these concerns by building a deepfake detection system capable of analyzing and detecting deepfakes in real-time. The system highlights the potential societal impact of deepfakes and provides a proof-of-concept for deploying real-time detection systems.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Processes live video feeds, analyzing frames on a real-time basis to detect deepfake content.
Transfer Learning: Uses MobileNetV2 and XceptionNet, pre-trained on the DFDC dataset, for efficient and accurate detection.
Frame-by-Frame Analysis: Utilizes OpenCV to preprocess and analyze each frame individually.
Webcam Demo: Demonstrates real-time detection capabilities using webcam input, showcasing the potential impact on curbing misinformation.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other dependencies are properly installed. Itâ€™s recommended to use Google Colab for ease of access to GPU resources.

Usage
Preprocess Video Frames: Use OpenCV to process videos frame-by-frame and prepare them for analysis.

Run the Detection System:

In a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, load the detection model and input a video or webcam feed.
The system will analyze each frame and output real-time predictions indicating the presence of deepfake manipulation.
Demo Using Webcam:

Run the provided webcam_demo.py file to test the detection system on live video input from your webcam.
Adjust parameters if needed for real-time performance.
Dataset
This project uses the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset for training. Download and prepare the dataset as instructed in the DFDC documentation.

Results
The system achieves robust performance in real-time detection scenarios, with results visualized on live video feeds. The frame-by-frame analysis allows for accurate detection and highlights the potential for scaling deepfake detection solutions to larger platforms.
