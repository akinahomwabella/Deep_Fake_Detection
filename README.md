 Project Overview
Deepfakes have become a prominent source of misinformation, challenging the integrity of online content. This project aims to provide a real-time solution to detect deepfake videos, analyzing each frame and identifying manipulated content. By harnessing the power of transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and XceptionNet, we can detect deepfakes with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.

 Goal
To build a scalable, real-time deepfake detection system to support the fight against online misinformation.

 Features
Real-Time Detection: Analyze live video feeds frame-by-frame to detect deepfake content instantly.
Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 & XceptionNet: Efficiently leverage pre-trained models to detect manipulations.
OpenCV for Frame Processing: Uses OpenCV for video preprocessing and real-time frame analysis.
Webcam Demo: Showcases the system's real-time capabilities with live webcam input, emphasizing its potential societal impact.
 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Matplotlib installed.
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/akinahomwabella/Deep_Fake_Detection/blob/main/Deepfake_Detection_.ipynb
cd deepfake-detection
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Google Colab Setup (Recommended)

For access to GPU resources, you can upload this project to Google Colab, where dependencies can be set up quickly.
ðŸš€ Usage
Running the Detection System
Preprocess Video Frames: OpenCV is used to process video frames individually, preparing them for model analysis.

Load and Run the Detection Model

In a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, load your model (e.g., MobileNetV2, XceptionNet) and input a video or webcam feed.
The system will analyze each frame in real-time, marking any detected deepfakes.
Run the Webcam Demo

Run webcam_demo.py to test the system on your webcam feed:
bash
Copy code
python webcam_demo.py
Note: Adjust parameters if necessary to ensure smooth real-time performance.
Example Notebook
An example notebook is provided in the notebooks folder to guide you through loading the model, preprocessing frames, and running the detection system on sample videos.

 Dataset
This project uses the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset,Face Forensics,Celeb-DF-v2 which includes a comprehensive set of real and manipulated videos for training and testing. To use this dataset:

Visit the DFDC dataset page on Kaggle to download the files.
Follow the instructions in the notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to preprocess the dataset.
 Results
The deepfake detection system achieved robust real-time performance, visualizing frame-by-frame predictions and successfully identifying manipulated content. Below is an example of our detection results on live video feeds:

Metric	Value
Accuracy	92.5%
Precision	89.8%
Recall	90.2%
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of frame-by-frame analysis in detecting deepfakes in real-time, with promising potential for large-scale implementation.
