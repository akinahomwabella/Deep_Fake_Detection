Overview
With the rise of misinformation through manipulated media, real-time deepfake detection is crucial for maintaining online content integrity. This project leverages 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and sequential models like LSTM/GRU to enhance deepfake detection accuracy, achieving a performance improvement of 45% over traditional methods. The project also integrates explainable AI techniques such as Grad-CAM++ and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to offer users insights into the model's decision-making process.

Features
Real-time Deepfake Detection: Processes live video feeds to detect manipulated content.
Explainable AI: Utilizes Grad-CAM++ and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to highlight regions in each frame contributing to the prediction.
Webcam Demo: Live demo setup for real-time video analysis and heatmap visualization, emphasizing model interpretability.
